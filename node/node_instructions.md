Hello! Sure, I'd be glad to help you get Node.js set up on your Ubuntu machine. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Update your package list**: Before you begin, make sure you've updated your local package index. You can do this with the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. **Install Node.js**: Node.js is available in the default Ubuntu repositories, but it might not be the latest version. If you need the most recent version, you can use a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) or a more modern version from a Personal Package Archive (PPA) provided by NodeSource.

- Using `nvm`:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install node
```

- Using NodeSource:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

3. **Verify the installation**: You can verify that Node.js is installed and check its version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

You should see a response like `v16.3.0` or whatever the version number you've installed.

4. **Install npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node.js, so you may want to update it with this command:

```bash
npm install npm@latest -g
```

5. **Verify npm installation**: Similarly, check the npm version:

```bash
npm -v
```

You should see a response like `7.15.1` or whatever the version number you've installed.

That's it for the installation part. Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new project as follows:

1. **Create a new directory**: You can create a new directory and navigate into it using:

```bash
mkdir my-node-project && cd my-node-project
```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**: You can initialize a new Node.js project with:

```bash
npm init
```

This will guide you through creating a `package.json` file for your project.

Now you have Node.js and npm installed on your Ubuntu machine, and a new Node.js project initialized. You're ready to start building your application! Remember, you can add Node.js packages to your project using the `npm install` command. For example:

```bash
npm install express
```

Would install Express.js, a popular Node.js framework.
